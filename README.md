# codeChallenge1
<p>Follow the steps below to complete the code challenge:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a <button> element on the DOM, you may do this in jQuery, or write it directly in the HTML code. Have the button text read "Generate".</li>

<li>Using jQuery, append a <div> element when you click the button.</li>

<li>Inside the <div> element you created in the previous step, create a <p> element that shows how many times you have clicked the button from the first step.</li>

<li>Inside the <div> element you created in step two, append two <button> elements. The text of the two buttons should read "Swap" and "Delete".</li>

<li>In a CSS file, any <div> created using the "Generate" button should have a Red background-color.</li>

<li>Clicking a "Swap" <button> should change its parent background-color from Red to Yellow.</li>

<li>Clicking a "Delete" <button> should remove its parent <div> container (and all of its contents).</li>
</ol>
<p>No need to do anything beyond the challenge described above. Once you are complete, check your code into a GitHub repo and submit via this application. Then quietly leave the room until the challenge is over.<p>
